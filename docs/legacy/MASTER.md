# Master Documentation

This repository's documentation has been consolidated into this single master
document to simplify navigation. Legacy, more detailed docs have been archived
under `docs/legacy/` for reference.

Contents included (summary):

- Quickstart & Setup (see `README.md` at repo root for full install steps)
- News sources: Glassnode (RSS), Santiment (GraphQL), The Block, 5phutcrypto, custom RSS feeds
- Economic Calendar behavior and configuration
- Background tasks and scheduler behavior
- Data format: `data/news_config.json` and `data/last_post_ids.json` (per-guild structure)
- Troubleshooting essentials and common errors
- Notes on migration: Messari → Glassnode (RSS). Legacy Messari tests archived in `tests/deprecated/`.

For detailed legacy docs, see `docs/legacy/`.

If you'd like a smaller or more structured division (e.g., API, Troubleshooting, Changelog), I can split this master doc into 2-3 focused files — tell me which sections you want separated.
